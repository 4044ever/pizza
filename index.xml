      <description>Brian&#39;s Baguettes There are many baguette recipes only, many bad ones, many good ones. From the many good ones I picked Brian&amp;rsquo;s. It&amp;rsquo;s easy, straight forward, and most importantly it makes really good baguettes!
Some notes from my side=&amp;gt; The poolish is essential! The poolish will give you the amazing taste. The water content you really need to ajust to your flour! 1% can make a difference. Very soft/sticky dough is not nice to work with and can be very difficult to shape.</description>

      <description>Pizza Calculator Here is your pizza dough calculator for Neapolitan style hand shaped pizza.
The recipe will adjust depending on how many pizza you plan to make, and how much gram dough per piece. For a âŒ€~25-30cm/10-12&amp;quot; pizza I typically use 250g.
After you put the dough in the fridge you can leave it there for a few days. Taste is getting better after 1 day, 1-3 days is the optimum.</description>
